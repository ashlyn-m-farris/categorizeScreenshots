To qualify as Science a piece of research must be correct and
reproducible.

To be correct and reproducible, it must be described in sufficient details
in a publication.

To be 'published' (to receive a seal of approval) the publication must be
checked for correctness by reviewers.

To be reproduced, the publication must be widely available to the
community and sufficiently interesting.

If you do research and don't publish, it's not Science.

Without peer review and reproducibility, chances are your methodology
was flawed and you fooled yourself into thinking you did something
great.

No one will ever hear about your work.

No one will pick it up and build on top of it.

No one will build new technology and products with it.

Your work will have been in vain.

You'll die bitter and forgotten.

If you never published your research but somehow developed it into a
product, you might die rich.
But you'll still be a bit bitter and largely forgotten.

At a certain age (16 - 21), one must rid himself of
all childish things. Throw away the toys,
children's books, video games, &., and embrace
adulthood.

Get real hobbies, read real books, do something
worth remembering.

Stop playing Warhammer, video games, &c., and
grow up!

If a former President can be criminally convicted
